# Delete Orders


## Overview

Every day there are many orders placed and processed. The management at the **Order Grid** in the Magento database are very risky and time-consuming for admins' work since they have to delete order one by one. The [Mageplaza Delete Order extension](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-delete-orders/) makes it more convenient for the admin - either manually or automatically - to help them delete orders easily with a single or bulk delete command. Also, admin will receive an email notification when Order is Delete by schedule.
